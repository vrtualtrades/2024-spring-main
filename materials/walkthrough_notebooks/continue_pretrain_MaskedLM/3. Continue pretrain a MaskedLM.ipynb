Imagine you want to train a classifier that uses doctor notes to predict diagnostics, you have lots of doctor notes but only a small portion of them are labelled with diagnosis. If you only use the labelled portion to train your classifier, the majority of your data are essentially wasted. You might then consider using all the doctor notes to `continue pretraining` the model so it gains a better representation of the domain and task of your interest before moving on to building your classification model using the labelled data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3KECu6EoqHOZ"},"source":["# Word of caution:\n","\n","Before jumping into `continue pretraining` a large-language-model, understand that this could be a very expensive endeavor due to the shear size (number of parameters) of the model.

The researchers that introduced RoBERTa investigated the design choices made in the original BERT model and identified a few improvement areas that lead to performance gain. Below are a few key areas where RoBERTa differs from BERT:\n","\n","1. Unlike BERT, where masking was performed only once during data preprocessing (training data was duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of training, resulting in each training sequence was seen with the same mask four times during training) resulting in a single static mask (`static masking`), RoBERT employed `dynamic masking` where different masking pattern was generated every time a sequence was feed to the model.\n","2. Unlike BERT, where the initial training tasks consisted of fill-mask and next-sentence-prediction, RoBERTa removed the next-sentence-prediction task from its initial tasks and focused only on the fill-mask task.\n","3. Further, unlike BERT, where short sequences were randomly injected and the sequence length for the first 90% of updates were reduced, RoBERTa was trained only with full-length sequences (T = 512 tokens), and RoBERTa used a larger byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding vocabulary as well as larger batch sizes in its training.\n","4. RoBERTa was also trained on a different dataset than BERT, but the dataset matches the overall quantity and quality of the dataset used for BERT.\n","\n","- [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta)\n","- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta)\n","\n","Keeping in mind that `RoBERTa` was trained using `Byte-Pair Encoding` tokenizers with casing and `base` has 12 layers while `large` has 24.
